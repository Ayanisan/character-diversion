# Character Diversion

**The Platform for Typographic Discourse**

##Introduction

In my research into the history of Hebrew and Latin typography, I noticed that although both writing systems can be traced back to the Phoenecian script, today they follow very different typographic paradigms. This differenciation began before typography itself was born as a consequence of the invention of the printing press in 1450 (source).

Steps of differenciation:

1. When Latin dicided to be written from RTL only
2. Different tools: Chizelling → Serifs
3. Jews persecuted and lving in the diaspora
   1. less technological development (in terms of printing)
   2. and living in the diaspora may have led them to cling to traditions more (this is a steep hypothesis that desperately needs a source!)

With this process of differenciation, not only did the two scripts set themselves apart from one another – they developed conventions.

### What are conventions (for)?



###Why → Question Conventions



1. questioning typographic convention
2. lack of forums that facilitates type specific discourse
   1. (come up with positive "why")

### How → Enable Discourse

1. Enabling people to have this discourse by having an 
   1. overview
   2. interactivity
   3. 

## Process (The What)

1. Platform

### Concept

In an attempt to buld a platfrom that facilitates typographic discourse, I put my attention to what this discourse needs and what existing platforms are missing. For this I distinguish between three kinds of discourse: the one that orbits around a specific type design project, another one that asks fundamental questions of where we want to take typography going forward and the last one that lives without a platform in the streets, backyards and lunch rooms.

The former is predominantly led by independent type designers and enthusiasts (source?). The second has been pushed by renowned designers in the form

##### Component Based Approach

For the longest time, it was common practice in web development to separate markup (HTML), styling (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript) (source). All styles would be written in a large CSS file and the same would be done with JavaScript. 

In recent years there has been a paradigm shift, however, towards a component based approach. In this approach, a website or an app would be divided into smaller elements and then the markup, styles and functionality for each element would be stored in a sperate file. Like many JavaScript frameworks, Vue.js uses a component based approach to front end development. 

A component is usually a generic shell which accepts data that will populate this shell.

```vue
<template>
	<button :style="`background-color: ${color}">
    {{label}}											  // ^^^^^
   // ^^^^^
  </button>
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    props: ['label', 'color'],
  }
</script>
```



One particularly appealing concept is the atomic design system. It is constructed from atoms, which form molecules, which in turn form organisms which live in templates and pages. In a UI context a button and a text input field can be understood as atoms and when put together to a search field they become a molecule
