#Character Diversion

**The Platform for Typographic Discourse**

##Introduction (too much I, I, I)

In my proposals, I studied potential relationships between Hebrew and Latin characters. More specifically, I looked at whether characters connections within a given script (like ›n‹, ›m‹ and ›h‹) exist—or could exists—between Hebrew and Latin characters. I discovered that while certain character groups bear the potential for new relationships, the modification of century-old letterforms and typographic conventions could be quite controversial.

While initially, I wanted to find the right format to showacse my considerations, I quickly shifted my energy towards building a platform where, yes, I could showcase my considerations—but also enabled others to respond to them. It became clear to me that a platform specifically designed for typographic discourse does not exists and could, in fact, be useful beyond the application of presenting the results of my proposals.

> Start with how important discourse is for a democracy and how important it is to facilitate this discourse. 

This thesis is a plea to challenge conventions by enabling discourse. This paper is not intended to suggest that the conventions we adhere to must all be thrown overboard. In fact, discourse may also reinforce conventions: There is a good chance that my proposal to establish new conventional character relationships between Hebrew and Latin will be vehemently critisized and rejected. And if, as Foucault puts it, the »will to truth« (1971, p.10) succeeds through the platform I am creating, all is won.

To guide you through my thought process, I will first explain what conventions are (especially in the context of Latin and Hebrew typography) and why it is essential to question them from time to time. Next, discourse—the challenging of conventions—is elaborated on an prerequisites are established. This will lead me to the core of this paper, the documentation of the design and development of the platform »Character Diversion«—enabling people to discuss character diverging from their conventional shapes. As has been the plan for the better part of my working on this project, I will briefly recount my experiences modifying a number of typefaces according to my ideas of new character relationships and the process of showcasing them on »Character Diversion«. I will finish with an outlook to where »Character Diversion« could be taken to, which features are missing and in which scope the platform could actually be realised.

##Questioning Conventions (The Why)

###What are conventions (for)?

According to Andrei Marmor (2009, preface, p. x), conventions are »rules that regulate human conduct«. He consitues that for conventions to develop one of the following three conditions must be met. (1) Conventions are social rules and are followed as a social fact. (2) There are practical reasons for people to follow certain rules. (3) The reason for obeying a conventional norm depends in part on others following it (Marmor, 2009).

In the typographic sense this means that some conventions can be explained with practical reasons—like writing from left to right because the majority of a population is right handed—while others only make sense for the mere reason that a critical mass is following those conventions and breaking them would cause more loss than gain (example?).

###Conventions in Hebrew and Latin Typography

The Latin and the Hebrew script both have their origins in the Phoenician script and while the Phoenician script is not used anymore, both Latin and Hebrew are living scripts. On their way to the 21st century they took very different paths, however. The two scripts developed distinct typographic conventions. This differenciation began before typography itself was born as a consequence of the invention of the printing press in 1450 (Gunaratne, 2001).

The Jewish tradition perceived both the Hebrew alphabet as well as the language as sacred. This is one of the reasons for why in the second century BCE Hebrew started being used mostly as a liturgical and literary language (Britannica, 2021), while Latin spread with the expansion of the Roman Empire (source). 

In its very early days, Latin (like Greek and Etruscan and other Phoenecian descendant like Hebrew) were written from right to left. As writing replaced chiselling, the Latin adopted the baustrophedon style which meant it could be written both from left to right and from right to left. After the first century BC almost all Latin inscriptions were written from left to right (Shores, 1965). Hebrew did not undergo this change in convention and remains written right to left, to this day.

Initially the character shapes of the Latin alphabet were mono-lined symbols with no stress and no serifs. This changed during the 1st century and the reason for this is mostly technical (Tselentis et al., 2012). The origins of serifs and stroke contrast, for example, are considered to lie in the Roman lapidary practice (i.e. the practice of shaping stone). Letters were painted on stone with a flat stiff brush—not a quill or a reed—and then chiseled into the surface (Friggeri, 2001). Hebrew characters developed stress and stroke contrast only more than a millenium later, and convened to a horizontal stress (as opposed to Latin vertical stress). The serif-like in-strokes in traditional Hebrew lettering, have technological origins, however different from Latin (Stern, 2003).

Many of those conventions were created and altered due to social and technological influences. Among other reasons, the Jewish people were scattered mostly around Europe living in the diaspora and faced continuous persecution, which prevented them from adapting the scribal letterforms to the context of typesetting. This way, the refinements that were made to the Latin script following the invention of the printing press were not applied to Hebrew (Wittner et al., 2018). 

I want to argue that some societies were subjected to the same techonolical innovations, yet they developed different conventions. Some immigrants hold on to their native culture to retain their identity and do so even more strongly than the people living in their home land (Kumar & Steenkamp, 2013). A mechanism of self-preservation the Jewish living in the diaspora surely applied. This may be yet another reason for why typographic conventions diverged even though societies lived side by side (more so in the physical space, and maybe less so in the social space (?)).

### Questioning Typographic Convention (go more specific to »typographic«)

Conventions emerge in a dialectic process but are not always established because they are truly best practices. Sometimes they were established in times of quite different technogical circumstance or for social reasons that may not apply today. Yet, some conventions are carried from generation to generation. But as our society strives for innovation, progress and adapting to new circumstances, our conventions need to change with us.

Clearly some conventions are of great value today even if their practical origins are obsolete—nowadays, most text is written on a keyboard and writing from left to right brings barely any practical benefints, however changing the convention or removing it brings no appearant benefit and the change would cause great disruption. But for a democracy to stay alive, the status quo needs to be questioned (source) and in this spirit I ask for conventions to be questioned. Not with the intention of abolishing or changing them but to inspect them, see if they are still useful and if they could be replace by more adequate conventions. 

This process of challenging conventions can happen quite naturally, as it has for millennia. It can also be initiated intentionally and he next chapter deals with what is needed to do so.

##Enabling Discourse (The How)

If discourse is necessary to re-evaluate conventions, how can this discourse be enabled? There are a number of prerequisites: (1) a (controversial) topic, (2) (people with) opinions, and (3) a platform (on which people with opinions can discuss controversial topics).

To Michel Foucault (1971, p.10), the »will to truth« is the driving factor that forges discourse. He also links discourse to power, arguing that control of discourse will result in control of how th world is perceived. And also in the wider field of social theory, discourse is often examined as a gateway to power.

### Controvesial Topics

In my proposals to this thesis, I explored the sociological impact of typographic hierarchies between the Hebrew and Arabic script in Israeli public space on the one hand and new potential character relationships between the Hebrew and Latin script. Both topics have controversial potential. Both also orbit around multiscript typography, what their differences bring and in which ways we can bring them together.

It was only consequential to work in my thesis on enabling *typographic* discourse. As

## A Platform for Typographic Discourse (The What)

There are a number of conference formats and forums that that provide a platform for typographic discourse.

### Digital Discourse

Jeff Atwood is co-founder of Stack Overflow and Discourse. In a blogpost on civilized discourse on the internet he contemplates on some of the issues and design decisions of current forum software.

> »At Stack Exchange, one of the tricky things we learned about Q&A is that if your goal is to have an excellent signal to noise ratio, **you *must* suppress discussion.** Stack Exchange only supports the absolute minimum amount of discussion necessary to produce great questions and great answers. That's why answers get constantly re-ordered by votes, that's why comments have limited formatting and length and only a few display, and so forth.« (Atwood, 2013)

### Concept

In an attempt to buld a platfrom that facilitates typographic discourse, I put my attention to what this discourse needs and what existing platforms are missing. For this I distinguish between three kinds of discourse: the one that orbits around a specific type design project, another one that asks fundamental questions of where we want to take typography going forward and the last one that lives without a platform in the streets, backyards and lunch rooms.

The former is predominantly led by independent type designers and enthusiasts (source?). The second has been pushed by renowned designers in the form 

### User Interface

Character Diversion is a platform for typographic discourse. Accordingly, typography and discourse should lie at the heart of the application. User experience and interfaces need to communicate clearly what the app does and how to use it.

#### Discourse

The benefit of recorded and structured discourse is that people can learn from it without engaging in it. The discourse lives, on the other hand, from participation. The user experience in respect to the discourse needs to properly summarize and display the status quo of the discourse as well as shouw an easy entry point for engagement.

#### Opinion

While the discourse is the structure that defines the topic an dholds the conversation together, the opinions are what bring this structure to life.

When I started with the design, opinions were merely comments, connected to glyphs and axes spectra. In the spirit of Jeff Atwood's comment about Stack Exchange, I had to consider how this element needed to be designed. Should opinions be forced to be concise and efficient by limiting the richness of the editor and reorganizeing the ordering through a voting system? Or would this limit the livelyness of the discourse?

I decided that opinions in fact needed more prominence.

##### How are threads treated?

Threads are sub-conversations that can evolve below a comment. They can be very helpful in multi-faceted conversations with many participants. Threads can, however, also reduce the overview over a conversation, and lead away from the topic. 

A question that came up was whether to consider comments below opinions as another kind of data, or to trat comments like opinions that are linked to other opinions. 

### Features

#### Linking Opinions to Glyphs

At the core of user experience design lies the questions of what a user want to achieve and how to most intuitively enable them to to it swiftly. So the implementation of opinions on type design begs the question of what users want to actually do (on top of simply sharing their opinion in written form) and how they would most intuitively try to achive that.

There are several approaches to this problem:

1. Users type their opinion and before posting it are presented with a (filterable) list of glyphs as well as, if applicable, range inputs for setting the spectra of the variable font axes.
2. Current convention of denoting letter reference with a forward slash (/) is made use of and referenced letters are recognised from the text of the opinion and automatically linked.

I decided to draw from both options: for this I created a lookup table for glyphs through which I can access all glyphs by entering either the literal glyph (/א), the postscript name of the glyph (/alef) and a name with a stylistic set extension (/alef.ss01). It also works on complex alternatives like /braceleft.case.ss01.

```js
{
	'א': {
    glyph: SamsaGlyph {
      id: 54,
      name: 'uni05D0',
      font: SamsaFont { ... },
      numPoints: 48,
      numContours: 1,
      ...
    },
    literal: "א",
    name: "uni05D0",
    postScript: "alef",
    unicode: "1488",
    unicodeHex: "05D0"
	},
	'alef': {
    glyph: SamsaGlyph { ... },
    literal: "א",
    name: "uni05D0",
    postScript: "alef",
    unicode: "1488",
    unicodeHex: "05D0"
	}
}
```



Another question that emerged was how to deal with the situation that a user wants to voice their opinion on several glyphs referencing them in a comment but saying distinct things about each of the glyphs. By default, all referenced glyphs are linked to the whole comment. Considering it is a lengthy comment referencing ten or more glyphs, the quality of the tool, the precise linking of opinions to glyphs is lost. 

This could be tackled by indeed selecting an opinion and thus filtering the glyphs, and then highlighting specific glyphs by hovering over each reference or paragraph. The usability of this idea needs testing.

#### Marking Elements in Glyphs

Another form of visually referencing what a user is critiquing, is marking elements in a glyph and linking it to a particular opinion. A glyph can have multiple marks that are all linked to their corresponding opinion.

####Voting and Responding to Opinions and Comments

Today, many social media platforms offer the possibility to react to content in many differenciated ways. The like buttons seemed to cause issues when people were posting about tragedies and followers were unsure if to like or not to like, when clearly they were not happy about the tragedy but wanted to show support.

#### Filtering Opinions and Comments

One goal of the platform is to creat and overview. In order to do that, the possibility of a large amount of opinions and comments needs to be taken into account. Opinions need to be filterable and sortable by date, votes, and (hash-)tags. 

#### Versioning

When implementing the platform into the design process of a typeface, versioning is indispensable. It is very common for a process involving design critiquing to involve versioning. A designer may upload a project font, commentators propose changes and the designer implements those changes. If there are 50 comments and the designer solves 20 of them in one round and tweaks another 15 in another go, how can those changes be kept track of? Do the opinions that were tackled become obsolete? And what is the workflow for marking those that become obsolete? Is it technically feasable to integrate an automatic change detection like the versioning control system Git or would each opinion need to be marked as obsolete? In addition to the management of obsolete comments, some sort of timeline would need to be added to look back at prior versions to comprehend the development.

Due to its complext implementation, this feature may, however, be developed in the future.

#### Structuring Opinions

A major question to overcome was the structure of opinions and how to design the interface.

#### JavaScript Framework

##### Component Based Approach

For the longest time, it was common practice in web development to separate markup (HTML), styling (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript) (source). All styles would be written in a large CSS file and the same would be done with JavaScript. 

In recent years there has been a paradigm shift, however, towards a component based approach. In this approach, a website or an app would be divided into smaller elements and then the markup, styles and functionality for each element would be stored in a sperate file. Like many JavaScript frameworks, Vue.js uses a component based approach to front end development. 

A component is usually a generic shell which accepts data that will populate this shell.

```vue
// CustomButton.vue
<template>
	<button :style="`color: white; background-color: ${color}">
    {{label}}
  </button>
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    name: 'CustomButton',
    props: ['label', 'color'],
  }
</script>
```

```vue
// App.vue
<template>
	<CustomButton color="#ff0000" label="Text in Button" />
</template>
```



One particularly appealing concept is the atomic design system. It is constructed from atoms, which form molecules, which in turn form organisms which live in templates and pages. In a UI context a button and a text input field can be understood as atoms and when put together to a search field they become a molecule. This molecule of a search field can be embeded into the organism of a header, side-by-side with a logo atom and a main-menu molecule. This organism of a header can live in a template or a page.

## Case Study

###Non-Conventional Hebrew-Latin Character Relationships



## Outlook

### Shortcomings

Exploring the design of a software for typographic discourse, I discovered a number of shortcomings.

#### Specificity

It lies in the nature of things, that specificity and specialization enables users to do one thing very well. 






### Potential Features

#### Image detection

The current design of the platform requires users to upload font files in order to refer to certain characters. The reality in typographic discourse is, however, that some questions orbit around typefaces that have not font files or the licensing disallows the upload of font files. Currenty those discourse are held by uploading imagery and even drawings of letterforms.

A potential future feature of Character Diversion could be the option to upload an image instead of a font and have to app automatically detect the letters, assign them to their Unicode symbol and allow users to associate opinions with those letters. This way a core functionality of Character Diversion would be extended to wide range of use cases.	



### Conclusion
