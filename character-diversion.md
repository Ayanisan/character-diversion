# Character Diversion

**The Platform for Typographic Discourse**

##Introduction

In my research into the history of Hebrew and Latin typography, I noticed that although both writing systems can be traced back to the Phoenecian script, today they follow very different typographic paradigms. This differenciation began before typography itself was born as a consequence of the invention of the printing press in 1450 (source).

Steps of differenciation:

1. When Latin dicided to be written from RTL only
2. Different tools: Chizelling → Serifs
3. Jews persecuted and lving in the diaspora
   1. less technological development (in terms of printing)
   2. and living in the diaspora may have led them to cling to traditions more (this is a steep hypothesis that desperately needs a source!)

With this process of differenciation, not only did the two scripts set themselves apart from one another – they developed conventions.

###Why



1. questioning typographic convention
2. lack of forums that facilitates type specific discourse
   1. (come up with positive "why")

### How

1. Enabling people to have this discourse by having an 
   1. overview
   2. interactivity
   3.
