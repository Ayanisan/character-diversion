# Ideas
- When hovering over different axes relevant character groups are shown. The axis extremes switch between the Hebrew and the Latin convention. This will not always be logical, so new term needs to be used. Sometimes Hebrew will be sharp and Latin version will be round but they need to be in syncâ€¦. So the axis will be e.g. SHLD: 0-1000 (radius) as in shoulder 
    - Virtual Masters
- Write everything in Markdown in a Github project. This way I can track all changes to text and files in the software that is used by type designers and software developers 
- People can write their names in the new font and a mini printer will print a name tag, in this somehow the character relationships should be visible
- Talmudic definition of Hebrew letters
    - Maybe I cannot really establish conventional relationships because there are no absolute conventions in Hebrew due to the different hands (Ashkenazic, Sephardic etc)
- Use CR to create coherence and design new character shapes.
    - Make posters
    - Provide tool for people to create new character shapes
