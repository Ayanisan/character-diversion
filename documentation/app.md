- Vue based for PWA potential
- Nuxt App to lay basis for potential publication
- Samsa seems to be great VF font library

## Architecture

### Tuple
*The state of the axes*
- There should a **global** tuple (to modify the entire font) and a **local** tuple for each glyph that can ovverride the global tuple
