## Elements
- Defining Character Relationships
- Designing/Modifying Font
- Developing App

## Define Success
- [ ] if to design new font or to modify existing fonts. I tend to modifying existing fonts because this way I can show conventionality and it is more time effective (copy right issues? â†’ write to the designers!)
- [ ] What is the scope of the project?
- [ ] What is my ideal outcome?
- [ ] What do I need to solve/accomplish? (Quantifyable?)
- [ ] Which discourse am I trying to enrich?
    - What is conventionality?
    - How are typographic conventional negotiated?
    - How to establish cross script coherence?
- [ ] What is the AHA-Moment?
- [ ] How can I describe it in two sentences? Understandable?
- [ ] What do people understand from it?
- [ ] What would people love about it?

## Testing
- Variable font features
- How many axes can I use

## Character Relationships
- Find a large number of possible cross-script character relationships
- Group them by degree of alteration
- Application of Character Relationships onto different typefaces
- Show a certain relationship in four different levels of grotesque.

## Variable Fonts
- How to create different layers
- How many layers (axes) can be applied across the font
- How many axes can be applied onto one character
